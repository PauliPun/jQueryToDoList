# jquery

This is my <b>To Do List</b> made with <b>jQuery</b>.

With the list you can:

<ul>
<li>Add to do items</li>
<li>Cross out finished items</li>
<li>Delete items</li>
<li>Select if you want to show all, finished or unfinished items</li>
<li>Sort the list by dragging the item</li>
<li>Clear the list by pressing a button</li>
</ul>
The code is based on my other Javascript To Do List, which was made with Vanilla Javascript.

This website uses Bootstrap and LocalStorage.
