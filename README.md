# jquery

This is my To Do List made with jQuery.

With the list you can:

-Add to do items
-Cross out finished items
-Delete items
-Select if you want to show all, finished or unfinished items
-Sort the list by dragging the item
-Clear the list by pressing a button

The code is based on my other Javascript To Do List, which was made with Vanilla Javascript.

This website uses Bootstrap.
